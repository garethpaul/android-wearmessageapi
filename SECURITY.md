# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported security scope for `android-wearmessageapi` is the current default branch, `master`. Older commits, tags, branches, forks, demos, and generated artifacts are not actively supported unless the repository explicitly marks them as maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting or by opening a draft GitHub Security Advisory for `garethpaul/android-wearmessageapi` when that option is available. If GitHub does not show a private reporting option for this repository, contact the repository owner through GitHub and avoid posting exploit details publicly until the issue can be assessed.

Do not open a public issue that includes exploit code, secrets, personal data, or detailed reproduction steps for an unpatched vulnerability.

## What to Include

Helpful reports include:

- the affected file, endpoint, permission, dependency, or workflow
- a concise impact statement explaining what an attacker could do
- reproduction steps using test data and accounts you control
- the branch, commit SHA, platform version, device, runtime, or dependency versions used
- logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept snippets that demonstrate impact without exposing private data

## Project Security Posture

- This repository appears to be an Android mobile application or sample. The active security scope is the code and documentation on the default branch.
- Review found network clients, sockets, web APIs, or service endpoints; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found mobile permission or privacy-sensitive data handling; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found file, document, data, or media parsing flows; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Dependency manifests detected: build.gradle, gradle.properties. Dependency updates should preserve lockfiles when present and avoid introducing packages without a clear maintenance reason.
- Pinned, read-only GitHub Actions runs the guarded `make check` baseline;
  review workflow, Gradle, and checker changes as part of the supply-chain
  surface.
- Wear message payloads are bounded to 4096 bytes, and the listener service
  owns delivery so messages do not depend on activity registration timing.
- Hosted checkout credentials are not persisted. Repository-wide CODEOWNERS
  and focused baseline checks cover CI, Gradle, wrapper, and module boundaries;
  repository rules should require owner approval and `Check / check`.
- Alternate manifests, packaged binaries, symlinks, hidden Gradle inputs, and
  `buildSrc` are rejected without freezing ordinary source and test edits.
- Hosted CI provisions pinned Java 8 and Android API 21 tooling and requires
  Gradle lint, unit tests, and debug assembly instead of accepting SDK skips.
- The Make targets download Gradle 2.2.1 from the official service and verify
  its published SHA-256 checksum before running any build logic.
- The exported Wear launcher strips external extras before opening the private
  message activity, which validates the bounded service payload again.

## Mobile Privacy Notes

If this project requests device permissions such as location, camera, microphone, contacts, Bluetooth, health data, or local storage access, reports should describe the permission involved and whether sensitive data can be accessed, persisted, or transmitted unexpectedly. Please avoid testing against real third-party user data or accounts you do not control.

## Dependency and Supply Chain Security

Dependency updates should come from trusted package managers and should keep lockfiles in sync when lockfiles exist. Do not commit credentials, private keys, tokens, generated secrets, or machine-local configuration. If a vulnerability depends on a compromised package, typosquatting risk, insecure transitive dependency, or unsafe build step, include the package name, affected version, and the path through which it is used.

## Safe Research Guidelines

Good-faith research is welcome when it stays within these boundaries:

- use only accounts, devices, data, and infrastructure that you own or have explicit permission to test
- avoid destructive actions, persistence, spam, phishing, social engineering, or denial-of-service testing
- minimize access to personal data and stop testing immediately if private data is exposed
- do not exfiltrate secrets or third-party data; report the minimum evidence needed to verify impact
- keep vulnerability details confidential until the maintainer has assessed the report

## Maintainer Response

The maintainer will review complete reports as availability allows, prioritize issues by exploitability and impact, and coordinate a fix or mitigation when the affected code is still maintained. For sample, archived, or educational repositories, the likely remediation may be documentation, dependency updates, or clearly marking unsupported code rather than a production-style patch release.
